  <p>I like playing guitar because it is fun to play the different songs and feel the vibrartions of the music on your hand. I also like to make up different songs. On the guitar you can make any combination of notes, and it will sound beautiful. Guitar is my favorite instrument. You can play melodies, chords, and other things on the guitar. I also like guitar because it is fun to pluck the different strings and hear the different sounds. Guitar is an amazing instrument, and it is not too hard to play. I mostly enjoy playing guitar because the music sounds different than most insturments. There are acoustic guitar, which sound better when playing melodies or soft chords, and there are electric guitars which sound better when playing chords. No matter what type of guitar though, it is still fun and entertaining to play. Guitar is not only just playing the strings, but when you listen to each string play, it sound amazing, which is the best thing about guitar.</p>
